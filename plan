actually I appreciate  this  step  of  begging   

I wanna    Reconstruct in my knowledge   in  Design  patterns  
And  then  move to  technologies 
  in order it would  be Like      
           1) Dotnet  Core  and  Angular/flutter&Dart/React  
            2) DEVOPS Operations  like “Docker  and  Kubernetes and   CI/CD”
            3) Python And  Machine Learning 
            4) Mean Stack diploma  which  is  (MongoDb,Node.js with node express, angular)
             Because  this  methodology  of  work  is  more  light 
            5)  GIS with  Arch Object & WPf  because  as  I  knowed  that  we  will  need   it for  our  work  here
